    <h2>Description</h2>
    
    <p>If you want the yummy taste of a slowly baked potato but aren't patient enough, or don't have the know-how to bake it in an oven, this is for you. Give it 12 minutes and get a mouthwatering, taste bud-tingling treat.</p>

    <p>When you're short on time or patience, waiting an hour or more for an oven-baked potato might seem like a tall order. That's why this recipe is so darn good – you can have a perfectly microwaved baked potato in just a little more than 10 minutes! It sounds too good to be true but, we promise, this recipe is just as good as reviewers say it is.</p>
