    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Chicken Breasts - (4) 5 oz.</li>
        <li>Olive Oil - 2 tbsp</li>
        <li>Sea Salt - 1/2 tsp</li>
        <li>Creole Seasoning - 1 pinch</li>
        <li>Chicken Broth or Water - 1 tbsp</li>
    </ul>


    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Place chicken in a broiler pan. Rub chicken breasts with olive oil and sprinkle both sides with salt and Creole seasoning.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. Flip chicken and cook until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 15 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Remove chicken to a plate. Pour chicken broth into the pan and scrape any browned bits off the bottom with a flat-edged wooden spatula. Add more broth if needed to dislodge the browned bits, but not too much or it will be watery.</li>
        <li>To serve, drizzle the pan sauce over the chicken.</li>
    </ol>
