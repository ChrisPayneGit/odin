    <h2>Description</h2>
    
    <p>This coconut rice is perfect! I tried many different ways to duplicate my favorite restaurant's coconut rice after they went out of business. It's delicious topped with toasted coconut and chopped cilantro.</p>

    <p>Coconut rice is so simple to make and delicious, it’ll quickly become a go-to in your side dish rotation. While coconut rice can be found across the Asian continent and throughout the Pacific, this recipe takes inspiration from a traditional Malaysian recipe called Nasi lemak. Countries like Thailand, Singapore, and Indonesia all have similar versions of coconut milk rice, so you can really explore the different ways to make it.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Uncooked Jasmine Rice - 1 1/2 cups</li>
        <li>Coconut Milk - (1) 14 oz. can</li>
        <li>Water - 1 1/4 cup</li>
        <li>Sugar - 2 tsp</li>
        <li>Salt - 1 1/2 tsp</li>
        <li>Coconut Oil - 1 tsp</li>
    </ul>


    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Rinse rice with water until the water from the rice is clear.</li>
        <li>Place rinsed rice, coconut milk, water, sugar, and salt in a medium saucepan; stir until sugar dissolves, about 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Bring mixture in saucepan to a boil over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Cover, reduce heat to low, and simmer, undisturbed, for 11 minutes. Turn off heat; steam, covered, until rice is tender and liquid is absorbed, about 10 minutes. Uncover and gently stir in coconut oil.</li>
        <li>Serve and enjoy!.</li>
    </ol>
